## UI ##
Users List View - I used a tableview to display the random users that https://randomuser.me returns. The cells show the image, name, mobile number and email address of the users.

User Details View - This view shows a round image view for the user's image, and multiple labels to display the user's detais.

## Design Pattern ##
The Design pattern I used in this app is MVVM. The reason I chose MVVM is because aside from this pattern being the one I'm most familiar with, I also believe that this pattern provides benefits to improve code readability and scalability.

## Libraries ##
Alamofire - I used this library to simplify network tasks. It also provides caching, which I used to cache responses from the API

KingFisher - I used this library for downloading and caching images from the URLs that is included in the API's response.
